Foreword # In this article you\u0026rsquo;ll learn:\nThe importance of ball exercises for learning animation Basic idea on what Ball Rig consist of Learn common slang for some controller types Understand what is happening in the code of \u0026ldquo;stretch\u0026rdquo; modifiers in popular programs 1. Why is ball important? # Whether you\u0026rsquo;re just starting your journey, study animation or you\u0026rsquo;re a seasoned animation veteran - the basics of everything you know about animation starts with a ball. If we take a look at Richard William\u0026rsquo;s The Animator\u0026rsquo;s Survival Kit, the first chapter title where he talks about animating is called IT\u0026rsquo;S ALL IN THE TIMING AND THE SPACING - and it\u0026rsquo;s all about how do we use these two terms in understanding the basics of any motion.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll never forget the image of this big Norwegian American sitting in the golden twilight, extending his long arms and spatula hands saying\u0026hellip; «The bouncing ball says it all»\n~R. Williams \u0026ldquo;The Animators Survival Kit\u0026rdquo;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I want my first post dedicated to building a proper ball rig, on which we can build basics of spacing, timing and squash \u0026amp; stretch principles and to look under the hood of rigging a mesh that can preserve it\u0026rsquo;s volume while being scaled.\nOf course, in 3D animation there are two main groups of users: Autodesk Maya and blender ones. I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to explain the ideas as software agnostic as possible, but there are going to be chapter for both Maya and blender rigging - so noone feels left out. I am going to use some scripts along the way, but every script/addon is going to look like this:\nExample - so you can install it yourself and follow along.\nBesides that, I am going to include rigs done in this series (as I want to rig with you all rigs that you\u0026rsquo;d commonly find in animation exercises) both as fully working rigs and basics to follow the tutorial totally free of charge and licensed under GPL v3.0.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested to hop into the world of animation technicality then let\u0026rsquo;s start!\n3. What is actually squash \u0026amp; stretch? # You\u0026rsquo;re probably familiar with the idea of squashing and stretching of stuff - it seems super simple. If we squash a water balloon, water inside will push the sides making it look like pancake. If we release it, it\u0026rsquo;ll spring back to the more natural shape and if we throw it - it\u0026rsquo;ll going to stretch in air before squashing on somebody\u0026rsquo;s face.\nA balloon squashing on a face, courtesy of gifer.com Disney\u0026rsquo;s Nine Old Men found that squashing and stretching of objects is one of the most important principles to create a good looking animation - probably that\u0026rsquo;s why they\u0026rsquo;ve made it the #1 principle in their 12 Principles of Animation and understanding it, is one of the building blocks of a strong animator today - because no matter if you draw your frames or manipulate a super complex humanoid body, you have to account for squash \u0026amp; stretch to achieve a real *illusion of life.\nThe mathematical explanation # We\u0026rsquo;ll start by eating the frog. As far as mathematics go, we are going to take a sphere that has dimensions of x, y and z and volume V1, we are going to multiply it by n in one direction and multiply it by 1/sqrt(n) in the rest to get a V2 that is the same as V1\n\\(\\text{Volume} = x \\cdot y \\cdot z = n \\cdot y \\cdot \\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\\)\nWhere: x, y, z - our sphere transform values\nn - the amount of change along we add, in this case along Y axis\nRigging explanation # In rigging there are multiple ways to achieve a volume preservation effect depending on the usage and outcome.\nIf you came to animation from modelling, the first idea that might pop to you mind is *Lattice Deformer.\nLattice around the cube object in Object Mode - from blender official docs Lattice is a deformer that is found both in blender( that color will mean it\u0026rsquo;s a blende term) and Maya (that color will mean it\u0026rsquo;s a Maya term) and it\u0026rsquo;s often used for applying deformation. For our purposes, deformation cage can be constrained and controlled, but while working on ball rigs (and I\u0026rsquo;ve saw a lot of Youtube videos using this idea), it\u0026rsquo;s not the most transferable way to create deformations, that\u0026rsquo;s why I am not going to talk about them in upcoming tutorials.\nSecond one, more in line with rigging tools themselves would be Stretch To Constraint/ Squash Deformer . Both of them are off-the-shelf features that are going to streamline building the mechanisms on simpler rigs, but might be limited in some more advanced setups. Because blender as of 4.0 didn\u0026rsquo;t add rigging nodes yet, we\u0026rsquo;ll be using Stretch To Constraint in blender-specific tutorial. How does it work under the hood?\nActually, the basic idea of doing a squash \u0026amp; stretch is joint scaling. When the object stretches, the joint (or chain of joints) is getting longer and whem it squashes, it naturally gets shorter. As this can be done both uniformly along all axes (thus making the chain bigger) and along specific ones - one might try to imitate what is happening to other axes at the same time. For that, we can use base math.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s do an example.\nWe have a bone of transform (x, y, z), where y will be the height.\nAs we know the y, we stretch the bone by vector \\(\\vec{v}\\) = [0, 1, 0] resulting in new transform of (x, y+1, z). As we know the new transform, we know that the new bone is higher from the default one by 1, but to sell the effect of stretching, we need to also make the bone smaller in other axes - therefore we can multiply x and z using the Volume formula I\u0026rsquo;ve given you before, looking like this: \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\), where n is the amount of transform we are adding by translation, in our case n = 1.\nIn Maya, we can use a Rigging Node Editor, to directly connect the channels of x, y and z with multiplyDivide node, to multiply the channels accordingly - achieving a good squash \u0026amp; stretch that is going to work on all type of bone chains - it\u0026rsquo;s extremly useful for humanoid skeleton rigs with cartoon features!\nSquash \u0026amp; Stretch in video games # Squash \u0026amp; Stretch isn\u0026rsquo;t something that you are going to see in video games a lot. At least\u0026hellip; not by default.\nUnreal Engine by default do not export scale of deformation bones at all! And while this can make you think - why bother? - is has a really good reason to do so. A volume-perserving squash \u0026amp; stretch in a Skeletal Mesh has to calculate skinning deformations every frame, making it one of the heaviest (or rather the most expansive) things for your CPU to do. Of course, sometimes whole art style might be broken because of that, but that\u0026rsquo;s why there\u0026rsquo;s a special option to enable bone scaling while importing the mesh to preserve them, but normally it has to be included in general optimalization or rather - it has to be a game feature, not a default.\nBecause of heavy optimalization implications there are different ways to sell this principle while animating for video games. You might see some slight translations of skeleton, arms or legs, sometimes the legs are becoming longer to stay on ground for a while to give more weight (World of Warcraft\u0026rsquo;s Pandaren jump loop), sometimes you will translate the skeleton a little to give a better pose - there are many different tricks to sell scalling and stretching you\u0026rsquo;ll learn while animating. Of course, it won\u0026rsquo;t be a real, calculated volume preservating squash \u0026amp; stretch, but it\u0026rsquo;ll create the illusion of life - and that\u0026rsquo;s what we aim for.\n3. How does a ball rig work? # Mesh # For this example I’m going to use a simple ball mesh with a checker texture that you can download:\nFor blender here For Maya here Skeleton # A ball skeleton in the easiest form is just one bone which joints or head and tail joints (that color will mean it\u0026rsquo;s a blender term) are the only pieces over which we will skin. Because there\u0026rsquo;s no deformation of these, we can use automatic weight painting.\nControls # If we think about a ball rig, there are a few basic things we\u0026rsquo;ll need.\nFor blender I\u0026rsquo;m going to use Bone Widget to create control shapes.\nFor Maya, I\u0026rsquo;m are going to use IDR ControllerTools to do the same. The list of controls:\nRoot - if you ever downloaded a rig, you probably know it as some kind of a circle or a variation of circle with arrows - it\u0026rsquo;s going to tell every software we work in what\u0026rsquo;s the default space of our object. The easiest way to think about it is to think that if we are going to move the root controller, everything will move along with it. In gameplay animation most of the time it\u0026rsquo;ll stay at default [0, 0, 0] position to mimic the player\u0026rsquo;s capsule. Center of Gravity - commonly known as cog or c.o.g is usually the control around hips or general center of gravity of your rig. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the main thing animators are going to use to give a sense of weight. For a ball usage, we\u0026rsquo;ll create a cog to move the ball in 3D space. Rotor - while it\u0026rsquo;s not something that you might find in every rig, I am going to add a second controller under the COG that is going to let us rotate the ball - why? To detach the translation of our ball from it\u0026rsquo;s rotation. It will help us with separating squash and stretch from the rotation. Squash and Stretch Controllers - as we are going to make our ball not only move and rotate but also to squash and stretch - we\u0026rsquo;ll need some controls to control the amount of squash and stretch. We\u0026rsquo;ll make two controls: at the top and bottom of the ball to give animators more flexibility when it comes to to proper animation. Because of the rotor control, we\u0026rsquo;ll be also able to rotate the ball independently of these controllers - in case the ball is going to hit a wall for example! 4. Closing Thoughts # So we\u0026rsquo;ve learned what is squatch \u0026amp; stretch, we know why is this principle important and we finally know how does it work.\nBesides that we have an outline on what do we need, to build a working ball rig, so let\u0026rsquo;s apply what we\u0026rsquo;ve learned in next articles!\n","date":"12 February 2024","permalink":"/adamblogstuff/posts/squashstretch/","section":"Posts","summary":"Overlook of squash \u0026amp; stretch mechanism building with with different rigging approaches","title":"Theory behind building a squash \u0026 stretch rig"},{"content":"","date":"12 February 2024","permalink":"/adamblogstuff/tags/blender/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"blender"},{"content":"Rigging the squash \u0026amp; stretch ball in blender # 0. Foreword # In this article you\u0026rsquo;ll learn:\nHow to rig a ball in blender How to create armatures and move them to snap bones in place How to use Bone Widget to create controls How to make clean layers in rig Basics of preparing rig for usage by other people 1. Preparation # As far as rigging in blender goes, we\u0026rsquo;re start by downloading the project files and Bone Widget.\nAttention: due to lack of rigging nodes (as of day of writing this post), we\u0026rsquo;ll need to do little hacking in the controllers hierarchy, that I\u0026rsquo;ll try to avoid later in the series, I\u0026rsquo;ll let you know where and why it happens.\nThe files are prepared for version 4.0, I am going to utilise new bone collections, so this part will look different if you\u0026rsquo;re on the old version of blender. 2. Armature and Skinning # After you start up your project file, it should look like this: View after opening the file First of all, we are going to create an armature in the proper axis. That\u0026rsquo;s why we\u0026rsquo;are going to click NUM3 to make our camera allign, making our left side the front, and our right side the back. We can add the Armature by clicking SHIFT + A and selecting Armature that\u0026rsquo;ll be created in the middle of the bar. Of course we can\u0026rsquo;t see it, so we can navigate to the right side, and by selecting Armature Data\u0026gt;Viewport Display we are going to enable\nNames - This option shows bone names, it\u0026rsquo;ll help us in defining bones on screen, without having to look all the time at the outliner. Shapes - It\u0026rsquo;ll let us look at controls later Bone Colors - It\u0026rsquo;ll let us change controller colors later In Front - It\u0026rsquo;ll render bones always in front, super useful for aligning stuff. Axes - It\u0026rsquo;s important for understanding our rotations. Armature Data in outliner With selected armature, we can change the mode to Edit by using Tab (It\u0026rsquo;s not a basic setting, go to Preferences \u0026gt; Keymap and select Tab for Pie Menu, it\u0026rsquo;ll make things faster later) Mode Select Pie Menu While in Edit Mode with the bone selected, I am going to use F2 to fast-change name of the bone to root - as I\u0026rsquo;ve explained it before, root always sits at the origin of the world, and thats where our root will sit too. Rename tool Now, in Edit Mode, we are going to select the Head of the bone, and by clicking SHIFT+S we\u0026rsquo;re going to choose Selection to Cursor. After that, by moving the head with G, I am going to clikc Y to lock axis and hit 1 to move it by 1m. Changing the root to world transform by using 3D Cursor Now that we know how to use 3D cursor, we are going to change the mesh origin point by first moving the 3D Cursor to Active, but in order to select the mesh, we need to use use TAB to get back to Object Mode. Changing the 3D Cursor to Ball Origin After we\u0026rsquo;ve done that, the next step is to create our only def bone, that we\u0026rsquo;ll call def_body. To do that, we are going to select the armature back, change to Edit Mode, then select it\u0026rsquo;s Tail and Extrude a bone after clicking Z to lock the axis as height. We are going to extrude it up to around the middle and rename the bone. Extruding a bone from root Clean outliner is your friend - rename things as early as possible to de-clutter things!\nAfter that, we are going to move the def_body bone to start in the middle of the ball by selecting the bone (make sure it\u0026rsquo;s not parented, if yours is, use ALT+P\u0026gt;Clear Parent) then by using SHIFT+S use Selection to Cursor. Your rig should look like this: Rig with proper deformation bone placed One super important thing for later is changing the rotation mode - with your bones selected in Pose mode use CTRL+R and select XYZ - we\u0026rsquo;ll touch it later! After that, we are going to bind the mesh to the bone in a process called skinning.\nTo do that, we are going to start by checking every bone in Bone Data tab of Properties to look if [ ] Deform is checked, we want our root to be unchecked while def_body should be checked.\nIn blender, bones with the prefix DEF are the only ones that should have deform checked, by doing that you\u0026rsquo;ll know which bones influence your mesh\nProperties of def_bone with Deform checked If all of these are checked (and believe me - it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to get a habit of checking that before skinning the model), we can start skinning process. To do that, go back to your Object Mode, select your Mesh, then with SHIFT select your Armature and by using CTRL+P\u0026gt; Armature Deform - Automatic Weights. Skinning process with Automatic Weights You might ask yourself - why using automatic? Is it always the best? The answer is sadly no - automatic weights is almost never the answer. Only models consisting of one mesh (or many single meshes like mechanical stuff) is okay-ish, but I still suggest to use Empty Groups and select Vertex Groups (information which skin touch what) yourself, but that\u0026rsquo;s beyond scope of this tutorial. After that, we\u0026rsquo;re going to check if our skinning worked properly by going to select Armature, then in Pose Mode moving first root and then def_body and see if ball works properly. Note: I am resetting transforms fast by hitting ALT+R and ALT+G for rotation and transformation. Checking if skinning is working right, we\u0026rsquo;ll do it every time after skinning With that, we\u0026rsquo;ve done our first phase of making the ball rig in blender. Now, to keep you on your toes, please parent the def_body to root with offset., here\u0026rsquo;s the fast guide in spoiler if you\u0026rsquo;re not sure how to do it.\nClick to reveal Go to edit mode Select def_body, then shift-click root\nHit CTRL+P -\u0026gt; Parent With Offset\n3. Making Squash \u0026amp; Stretch mechanism # As I\u0026rsquo;ve talked about what\u0026rsquo;s the math behind the good squash and stretch ratio, blender comes with a pre-built constraint that is going to do the work for us. There are some advantages of this, although personally I\u0026rsquo;d prefer rigging nodes like in Maya.\nThe constraint I\u0026rsquo;m talking about is Stretch To that looks like this: Screenshot of Stretch To from blender docs As I am not a fan of explaining perfectly created documentation, here\u0026rsquo;s the link to Stretch To Constraint. I am going to touch things, that we\u0026rsquo;re really interested in:\nTarget - it\u0026rsquo;ll be the the \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; of our squash \u0026amp; stretch target Maintain Volume - it picks which axes should be affected to preserve the virtual volume stretching along Y axis. Let\u0026rsquo;s get back to our rig. We\u0026rsquo;ll start by creating our *stretch mechanism. To do that, we are going to copy our def_body bone, then select the tail and by resetting the 3D Cursor to World Origin move the tail to the new cursor position. But to do that, we are going to learn about Bone Collections.\nBone Collection Menu in Properties Tab You can think of Bone Collections like layers in any other software - in blender 4.0, developers actually revamped old system (which had 16 normal and 16 protected layers) and made them actually unlimited. By using + button, we are going to add some layers and make it look like this:\nI\u0026rsquo;ve added five different layers that we\u0026rsquo;re going to use for the whole tutorial The most important thing to understand here is that if we click a bone, and it has a dot near the name of the collection, then it\u0026rsquo;s a part of the collection - and we can hide/unhide them. Be careful - you cant parent/unparent to bones that are actively hidden!\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to sort the bones we\u0026rsquo;ve created with the prefixes they added. Sorting out the bones to the right layers With that done, we can finally do the mch_stretch bone. Lets start with our sequence again: we are going to copy our def_body bone, then select the tail and by resetting the 3D Cursor to World Origin move the tail to the new cursor position. Stretching mch_stretch to it\u0026rsquo;s proper position Now, looking back to our control list, we need to add something, to control out stretch from both sides - to do that, we\u0026rsquo;re going to need two controls, but general cleaniness of rigging means that we are going to use target bones making our constraits separated between deformation skeleton that will follow our target skeleton (tgt and sometimes mch), that will follow control bones which animators are going to move. You can think of it as something similar to Maya\u0026rsquo;s offset groups which are used to make the controllers themselves at transform [0, 0, 0]. As always - we\u0026rsquo;re going to build habits that will make us better riggers in the future.\nWe are going to extrude two bones on Z axis, one from bottom and one from top of the mch_stretch, we\u0026rsquo;re also going to name them tgt_stretch-top and tgt_stretch-bottom and Clear Parent. Creating target bones for the stretch controlls, notice I am checking if the things separated properly Again, I am going to leave you some exercises. In the next step, we are going to assign proper bone collections and create a tgt_body and that will control def_body. Remember to uncheck deform! Besides that, we are going to copy tgt_body once more and call it tgt_cog\nAfter we\u0026rsquo;ve done that, we should end up with a hierarchy like this:\nroot def_body mch_stretch tgt_stretch-top tgt_stretch-bottom tgt_cog tgt_body Now, to explain how this ball\u0026rsquo;s mechanism will work, we are going to do two things:\nAdd stretchTo to mch_stretch parent things properly And then we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about why does it work like this.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start by adding the constraint. To add them, we need to be in Pose Mode. You can add them by using SHIFT+CTRL+C or by going to Properties\u0026gt;Bone Constraints. We\u0026rsquo;re going to pick Armature as our target and tgt_stretch-top as our bone target. After that, we can check if it works properly. We could also shift-click our target bone \u0026gt; bone we add constraint to to automatically select it After that we\u0026rsquo;re going to parent our mechanism the proper way. Think of it that way:\nWe want to move everything by tgt_cog, meaning it should be at the top of the hierarchy After that, we want our stretchers, to follow the cog, so they should be children of cog We want our mch_stretch to stretch in both ways by moving either contoller and not move the other one, which means that stretch needs to be a children of one of them - because our stretch works with tgt_stretch-top we don\u0026rsquo;t need stretch to follow it, so we can freely make it a child of tgt_stretch-bottom We want to be able to keep rotation independent of the stretch, so it needs to happen after stretching - basically making the rotation happen AFTER, by making it a children We end up with a hierarchy like this\nroot def_body tgt_cog tgt_stretch-top tgt_stretch-bottom mch_stretch tgt_body While it might be hard to remember how Parent actually works, think that it\u0026rsquo;s always CHILDREN first being grabbed by PARENT at last 4. Controls # We don\u0026rsquo;t really want animators to touch our rig insides, so for the ease of all we are going to create controls for our rig - remember, we\u0026rsquo;re rigging for somebody else - so we need to make rigs in a way clear enough that other people understand it as well. Because of that, in this sub-section I am going to talk about some conventions.\nTo start, we need to make our mesh follow our target bones first. In this case, because we have only one deformation bone, it\u0026rsquo;ll be super easy and I am going to let you do it yourself!\nThe goal is to add a Copy Transforms constraint to def_body and select tgt_body as the target.\nIt should look like this, if you can\u0026rsquo;t select it - unhide def bone collection Now, we can look if every control works properly - we can disable all other bone collections\nA quick look if we can do everything even if we disable other bones than target ones After a check, we are ready to create controls! Remember to get Bone Widget for this step.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start by looking at different controls first and we are going to start with a root control. While in blender armature modifier creates a joint that we can use, it\u0026rsquo;s always a good idea to create a control for your root bone, that will let you do some tricks like progressive walks (adding motion to root bone to mimic what game engine does).\nThere are different shapes for root bones:\nVayne Rig by Matheus Lima @ artstation AZRI Rig by popular autor Jonathan Cooper, author of GameAnim: Video Games Explained Uncle Death Rig for blender by Crabnuts (@Kani_Natto_), blender rig controls are generally lighter and less saturated As you see, there are few popular shapes and I\u0026rsquo;m sure that you\u0026rsquo;ve encountered even more - but mostly they are circular (sometimes squared) with or without arrows. In Bone Widget, we have an option to add one of two (Root 1, Root 2), and for the Vayne-styled one, we are going to create \u0026ldquo;Root 1\u0026rdquo;.\nTo do that, first we need to create a copy bone of root and name it ctrl_root and add it to a proper bone collection. As controls are going to mimic our target bone hierarchy, you can leave it unattended under Armature.\nWe can easily leave it in hierarchy as we\u0026rsquo;ll mimic target one Next, we are going to do switch to Pose Mode and hit N, to open the sidebar. By picking Rig Tools, we open up Bone Widget and select Root 1 as the shape. Then we can click Create, to create the shape. After done that, I am going to give you a simple exercies - your task is to copy all target bones and rename them ctrl_* where * is the relative name. Remember, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to copy MCH one. After that, we can parent it to mimic tgt bone hierarchy.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s also where the hack I\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about happens - do not copy tgt_body, we\u0026rsquo;ll create a control from it (so you can move it to ctrl collection), because otherwise the rotation will break.\nRemember to add them to collections afterwards To get more clarity, we are going to add copy transforms from ctrl bones to tgt ones, this time doing it faster, by shift clicking one after another like this If you cant click the bone, you can always select it in outliner Let\u0026rsquo;s now think about our other controls. We\u0026rsquo;ll start by creating something for the ctrl_cog and tgt_body. A standad cog (and sometimes called hips) is some kind of a circle, and we\u0026rsquo;ll go with that, we are going to create a smaller circle for the rotation. When you add a shape, you can also change it\u0026rsquo;s shape by clicking Edit button, by doing that, I can easily re-size the controls.\nYou can notice, that I\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten to add tgt_body to the right collection before and it didn\u0026rsquo;t let me create shape because tgt was hidden Stretching controls can vary from rig to rig, but for the case of our rig, we are going to consider is as auxilary controls - which means that we need to create a shape, that\u0026rsquo;ll convey the idea behind what it does, so an animator can understand how to work with the rig. You can think of controls building kinda like designing UX for the animator - you want to use marker - things, that by form, shape or color will subconsciously give an idea on how to work with your designed thing (for more about markers in design, you can check The Design of Everyday Things by Donald Norman).\nFor my markers, I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen pyramids - they are pointy on one side, so they can lead the eye to the center of the ball naturally making animator think that if he translates the controller to the inside, something will happen.\nAs we\u0026rsquo;ve learned how to do it, you can add them yourself, at the end it should like this\nIf you select two bones, you can add the same shape at the same time! As you see, my pyramids are smaller and moved up, and you can achieve that either by using Edit, or by the menu that appears in the down left corner\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;ve experience enough rigs, you start to see that colors in rigging are usually the same no matter who creates them. While I was researching the history of them, I\u0026rsquo;ve established my own control scheme that I am going to pass down for you:\nLeft side controls are RED Right side controls are BLUE Middle side controls are GREEN Auxilary controls are YELLOW We can change our controls colors in Bone\u0026gt;Viewport Display. I usually change them to a custom color theme and use the button next to it, to copy them to other controlls (the object you are copying from is LAST), let\u0026rsquo;s try it by adding yellow color to rotation and stretch controllers. We\u0026rsquo;re going to select ctrl_stretch-top and add a custom color theme under their Viewport Display tab, set them up to YELLOW, and then by selecting rest of the control hit the double arrow button.\nBlender uses a specific setup where you give 3 colors - Regular / Select / Active As you know how to add controls, let\u0026rsquo;s wrap this up, by adding colors to the rest of controllers. You should end up with this:\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve almost done! 5. Clean up \u0026amp; final touches # So, we\u0026rsquo;ve finally created everything, we could start animating right away!\nWRONG! I\u0026rsquo;ve told you at the start that mess is going to be a pain in the ass, so let\u0026rsquo;s do final cleaning up.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with Armature Tab - we can finally check off Names, In Front and Axes tab - animators don\u0026rsquo;t really need them and if they need to have controls in front, they\u0026rsquo;ll set them up.\nYour rig should look like this The last thing we should think about is locking up some transforms - I am generally against limiting animators choices, but there are some things we can do, to help animators in their work.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with stretch controllers - while animator can use Transform (location), adding rotation or scale is only going to rotate the control, without any real consequences - we can lock it, so he can work with just pressing G to control the stretch. You can hold LMB and drag to lock more than one thing at a time After that lets think about our rotation control - we don\u0026rsquo;t really need the scale, so it should be locked. Rotation is the main thing so it should be open, but what about location? I\u0026rsquo;d say tha there are two schools when it comes to that. First school would lock it out (because the control isn\u0026rsquo;t to do that), but I believe it\u0026rsquo;s better to leave it open - animators are going to see if they would add a keyframe to the wrong controller and fix it themselves, but sometimes they might need to detach the translation to two different bones and this setup will let them. Sadly, it can break our squash \u0026amp; stretch - I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it to your call, but for my example I am not going to lock it.\nWhen it comes to cog, it\u0026rsquo;s the main control which animators are going to move the mesh with, so location and rotation should be open, as far as scale goes - I\u0026rsquo;m going to lock it to avoid bugs.\nAnd lastly the root control - of course location and rotation should be unlocked. As far as scale goes - with our setup (of making the hierarchy the same) user can easily scale the root to achieve bigger balls - as controls are going to scale too and the rig will work! Of course it\u0026rsquo;s not always the case with rigging and sometimes you\u0026rsquo;ll need to plan if a rig should be scalable or not and you\u0026rsquo;ll have to create the controls appropriately.\nWith that we\u0026rsquo;ve finally finished our rig! You can start learning animation right away with your own, self-rigged ball! Good luck in your animation journey and if you decide to share your ball animation, I\u0026rsquo;ll be happy to be tagged (@arahfx) to see what you created!\n6. Closing Thoughts # Congratulations on rigging your first, fully working ball rig! Now, you can start your animation journey by tackling bouncing ball exercises. Besides that we\u0026rsquo;ve now have idea on how to plan our controls and name them properly, which will be super handy later.\nAs you are probably as happy as me, I am not going to hold you any longer - after you master the ball, the animation world will be your oyster!\n","date":"12 February 2024","permalink":"/adamblogstuff/posts/squashstretch_blender/","section":"Posts","summary":"A step by step guide to build your first ball rig in blender","title":"Squash \u0026 Stretch Ball in blender"},{"content":"Hey! I\u0026rsquo;m Adam. # I am an Animator / Rigger, based in Wrocław, Poland. Currently, I am working at Far From Home where I am animating and rigging Forever Skies!\nWelcome to my blog, where I explore the art of rigging, gameplay animation and *technical animation. This blog serves as a blend of insights into rigging techniques, animation principles, scripting, and their application in the dynamic world of video games.\nBeyond discussion, my goal is to offer valuable tutorials and resources to aid you on your (and mine) journey through everything there is related to animation for video games. I\u0026rsquo;ll also try sprinkle in some thought-provoking book reviews and reflections on the broader animation industry. I believe in the power of animation as the ultimate storytelling medium in the entertainment industry. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share my experiences and perspectives on every facet of this captivating medium.\nMy unique background encompasses both art (Graphic Design) and engineering (Computer Science), a blend that has propelled me into the specialized field of technical animation.
