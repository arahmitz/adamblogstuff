## Games I've been a part of
### Forever Skies (PC, PS5)
![Forever Skies main logo](/images/foreverskiesmain.jpg "[Forever Skies](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641960/Forever_Skies/_) - Animation & Rigging")
Forever Skies is the first project I am working on as an animator/rigger. I've been working mostly on third and first person animations, rigging and skinning of humanoids, non-humanoids
and devices for Unreal Engine 4 and I've been helping in implementation of the animation system within the project.

## My own projects
###  Rigs for Animation Students in blender & Maya

I've been working on bringing basic animation rigs like balls, pendulums, tails and walker animation rigs to help students with both learning how to rig these.
On many Polish gamedev networking events I've noticed a lack of good quality basic rigs for blender and that's why I wanted to give back to the community by making
something that might work software independently (of course it's not possible by doing it once, so I just rig & create tutorials for both softwares).
