## Forever Skies (PC, PS5)
![Forever Skies main logo](/images/projects/foreverskiesmain.jpg "[Forever Skies](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641960/Forever_Skies/_) - Animation & Rigging")

*Forever Skies* is a first-person post-apocalyptic survival game. Return to Earth, ravaged by an ecological disaster. Fly, upgrade and customize your mobile high-tech airship base. Scavenge resources to survive, face dangers on the surface and hunt for viral pathogens to cure a mysterious illness.

In *Forever Skies*, I am responsible for animation and rigging within the project. I am focused on the blender-related side of the pipeline where I rig bipeds, non-bipeds, weapons and structures. Additionally I am
responsible for many animations within the project - I've been mostly adapting already-done FPP animations into TPP (for co-op purposes), but I've also done my share of FPP animation, weapon, structure and non-humanoid sequences both in
blender and using UE4's Sequencer. 

Beyond the creative aspects, I actively contribute to integrating animations into Unreal Engine 4, ensuring a seamless and immersive gaming experience. I strive to create a better animation pipeline, actively using python to address and solve
various technical challanges, thus optimizing our workflow within the team.
