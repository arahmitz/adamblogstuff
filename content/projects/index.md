### Forever Skies (PC, PS5)
![Forever Skies main logo](/images/projects/foreverskiesmain.jpg "[Forever Skies](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641960/Forever_Skies/_) - Animation & Rigging")

Forever Skies is a first-person post-apocalyptic survival game with co-operation option. During the game players fill the role of a scientist sent back to destroyed Earth in order to find a cure for a mysterious disease. 
To achieve success, players have to avoid dangers, scavenge the Earth for resources, craft tools and build an Airship, allowing them to travel across the Skies. 

I am responsible for animation and rigging within the project, mostly working on adapting first person animation into
third person perspective (for co-op purposes), rigging and animating tools, strutures and enemies. Besides that
I am working within sequencer building cutscenes and work on pipeline-related stuff.
