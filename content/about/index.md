# Hey! I'm Adam. 
I am an Animator / Rigger, based in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. 
Currently, I am working at [Far From Home](https://www.farfromhomegames.com/) where I am animating and rigging [Forever Skies](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641960/Forever_Skies/)!

I've created this blog to share my thoughts and findings about **rigging**, **gameplay animation** and **technical animation** in general. 
Thats why the main topics here are going to blend between things like rigging, animation, scripting and implementation of these in video games.

Besides that I am aiming to deliver some tutorials and resources that might help you in your rigging and/or technical animation journey, splash in some book reviews
and general animation industry related thoughts. I strongly believe in animation as a final medium for storytelling in entertainment industry and I am 
eager to share my experiences and thoughts about everything this medium touches.

I come from an unique background as I've studies both art (Graphic Design) and engineering (Computer Science) - a mix that I believe made me the
dive into this very narrow field that is technical animation. Besides work I am a reportage photographer working on my digital photography books, 
a cinematography freak and an RPG (both digital and analogue) player.

I hope you'll enjoy your time here!

If you have any questions or just want to chat - I am open to DMs at both my X and LinkedIn accounts that you can find on top :)
