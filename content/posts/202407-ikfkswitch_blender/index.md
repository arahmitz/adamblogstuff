## 1. Why do we need an IKFK switch?
### What do IK and FK mean?
If you're new to the concepts of **FK** (Forward Kinematics) and **IK** (Inverse Kinematics), then let's start with a quick overview - these terms relate to how the bone chain behave in animation.

### Forward Kinematics
![Forward Kinematics Driven Arm](/gifs/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_01.gif "Forward Kinematics Driven Arm")

Forward Kinematics - **FK** for short - is a standard bone chain behavior. In an FK setup, each bone in chain follows the transformations of it's parent. For example, let's look at an FK_Arm setup:
```
arm
    forearm
        hand
```
Rotating the *arm* is also going to rotate the *forearm* and *hand* because they are down in the *arm*'s hierarchy. Typically, these chains are controlled by rotation of each bone. Translation might be possible in some setups, but it
isn't the standard. Forward Kinematics chain is great for creating smooth, natural arcs in animation, as it requires keyframing each bone individually, it promotes overlapping by offsetting each bone keyframes.

### Inverse Kinematics
![Inverted Kinematics Driven Arm](/gifs/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_02.gif "Inverted Kinematics Driven Arm")

Inverse KInematics - abbreviated as **IK** - works in the opposite manner. It makes the end bone of the chain the primary motion driver. In an IK setup, moving the end bone (like *hand* in our arm chain) influences the positions and rotations of the parent bones
(*arm* and *forearm*). This allows for both rotation and translation of the end bone, with the parent bone adjusting to maintain the correct position. To help control the rotation and bending direction, IK setups include a *pole target*, to which
the bend "points to".

IK is particularly useful for animating limbs that interact with the environment, such as a foot maintaining the contact with the ground during a walk cycle. The end bone (*foot* in this case) can be "pinned" in place, while the rest of the body moves,
providing stability and precise control over the limb's position.

## 2. How to create an IKFK switch in blender?

### Preparation

First, if you havem't already, download the [project files](https://github.com/arahmitz/am_ikfkswitch_tutorial). 

{{< alert >}}
The files are prepared for version 4.0, but should be backwards compatibile with older blender versions.
{{< /alert >}}  

After opening the *ikfkswitcher_start.blend* file, your screen should look like this:
![ikfkswitch_start.blend](/images/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_01.jpg "Clean ikfkswitch_start.blend file")

Close the note by dragging the viewport corner over it, and let's start rigging!
![Closing the text panel](/gifs/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_03.gif "Closing the text panel")

### Parenting the FK Skeleton

To start, switch to *Pose Mode* and make sure the bone names are visible. Select the *fk_* bone first, then <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>-click to select the corresponding *def_* bone. Press <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to
open the *Bone Constraints* context menu and choose **Copy Transform**.

![Adding copy transform to fk_upperarm](/gifs/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_04.gif "Adding copy transform to fk_upperarm")

Next, rename the constraint to **FK_CopyTransform** to keep things organized.

![Renaming the copy transform constraint](/gifs/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_05.gif "Renaming the copy transform constraint")

Repeat this process for the remaining *fk_* bones, Once done, your rig should look like this:

![Renaming the copy transform constraint](/gifs/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_06.gif "Remember to check if your constraints works properly!")

### Parenting the IK Skeleton

For the IK skeleton, follow the same steps as for the FK skeleton: add a *Copy Transform* constraint to the *ik_* bones and rename the constraints to **IK_CopyTransform**.
{{< alert >}}
Note: There's both *ctrl_ik_hand* and *ik_hand* bones. First one is the one you're going to use to move the IK arm. Ensure you constrain *def_hand* to *ik_hand*.
{{< /alert >}}  

![Adding copy transform constraint for IK bones](/gifs/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_07.gif "Adding copy transform constraint for IK bones")

After adding the **IK_CopyTransform** constraints, your *def_* bones should no longer follow the *fk_* bones. Blender's constraint system reads from the bottom up, and checks the first constraint with 100% influence. If IK_CopyTransform is set to 1, it wont
read FK_CopyTransform at all. We'll use this blender property for the next step.

### Creating a Custom Property

There are different approaches to where the IKFK property should be located and as a rigger, it's your choice where will you add it. For the simplicity, we'll use the *Root* bone at the world's origin. To add a property, click on the *Root* bone and navigate to
Bone Properties, then open the *Custom Properties* menu.


![Finding the Custom Properties menu](/gifs/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_08.gif "Finding the Custom Properties menu")

Click the **+ NEW** button, then use the cog icon to set up the property as follows:

- **Type**: Float (we'll use the value from 0 to 1, allowing for a blend of both IK and FK influences)
- **Property Name**: IKFK_Switch
- **Default Value**: 1.00
- **Min** and **Max**: 0.00 and 1.00, respectively
- **Soft Limits**: [ ] (not used)
- **Step**: 0.10 (changes how much the value incremets with each left or right arrow click)
- **Precision**: 3
- **Subtype**: Plain Data
- **Description**: "Switches from IK to FK constraint" (for clarity)
- **Library Overdrive**: [x] (check this to ensure properties carry over when referencing rigs to other scenes)

Your menu should look like this:
![Custom property options](/images/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_03.jpg "Custom property options")

### Adding the Custom Property as a CopyTransform Driver

Next, right-click the property and select *Copy as New Driver*
![Custom Property Right Click menu](/images/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_04.jpg "Custom Property Right Click menu")
Navigate to the *def_* bones and right-click on the **IK_CopyTransform** influence:
![Copying the Driver to IK_CopyTransform Influence](/gifs/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_09.gif "Copying the Driver to IK_CopyTransform Influence")
If the driver window dissapears, don't worryâ€”right-click the influence again and select *Edit Driver*.

Set up the driver as follows: 
- **Type**: Scripted Expression (we want to use our variable in an expression)
- **Expression**: `1-IKFK_Switch`

The name must match your Custom Property name. This expression ensures that when the *IKFK_Switch* is set to 0, the *def_bone* follows the IK skeleton and when set to 1, it follows the FK skeleton. We're substracting
because, as mentioned earlier, blender constraints read from bottom to top. If `IK_CopyTransform` has an influence of 0, blender will automatically use the next "full" influence constraint, `FK_CopyTransform`.

So, when *IKFK_Switch* is **1**, the expression is **1 - 1 = 0**, disabling the IK_CopyTransform. When the *IKFK_Switch* is **0**, the expression is **1 - 0 = 1**, enabling `IK_CopyTransform` and making the IK control the *def_* bones. 

If the rest of the driver setup isn't filled automatically, click *Copy Full Path* of the Custom Property you've created and paste it in the driver editor.

The finished driver should look like this:
![Finished IKFK_Switch Driver](/images/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_05.jpg "Finished IKFK_Switch Driver")

Now, right-click the newly created driver (indicated by violet color instead of blue) and use *Copy Driver* to copy it to the rest of *def_* bones.
![Copying the driver to the rest of the *def_bones*](/gifs/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_010.gif "Copying the driver to the rest of the *def_bones*")

### Using the Custom Property

That's all! Now we need to test if everything works properly. Click on *Root* bone and go to the Transform Tab to see the IKFK_Switch property.
![IKFK_Switch Property](/images/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_06.jpg "IKFK_Switch Property in Transform Tab")

If it's there and you can move it from 0 to 1, pose both IK and FK bones and try switching between them. If everything was done correctly, the skinned arm should move between the poses you've created!
![Checking if the property works](/gifs/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_11.gif "Always check if systems you've created work properly")

### **BONUS**: Hiding unused controls with IKFK Switch

As a bonus, let's add a quick Quality of Life upgrade for our IKFK switch. Typically, with the controls set up as described earlier, you would need to manually show and hide the IK and FK controls. While this is manageable, 
as riggers we should aim to enhance the user experience. Therefore, we will streamline process by adding a couple of additional drivers.

First, return to the *Root* bone's properties and again use *Copy as New Driver* for the IKFK_Switch property. Navigate to the Armature tab, right click the eye icon of the *ik* bone group, and select *Paste Driver*.
![Copying driver to Bone Collection visibility button](/gifs/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_12.gif "Copying driver to Bone Collection visibility button")

Next, right-click the visibility button and choose *Edit Driver*. Set up the driver as follows:

- **Type**: Scripted Expression
- **Expression**: `1-IKFK_Switch`

After setting this up, test to ensure the IK controls dissapear when the IKFK_Switch is set to **1**.
![Testing the IK switch](/gifs/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_13.gif "If the driver is setup correctly, the IK controls shouldn't be visible when IKFK_Switch is set to 1")

To apply the same logic to the FK chain, copy the driver from *ik* bone collection, paste it to the *fk* bone collection visibility, and change the expression to `IKFK_Switch`. This ensures that when the property is set to **0** (making the IK chian visible
and active), the FK chain is hidden.
![Adding a driver to FK Bone Collection](/gifs/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_14.gif "Remember to change the expression, otherwise both bone groups are going to be visible only on **0**")

Once the setup is complete, one of the collections should dissapear accordingly. Now, test the rig: if the IKFK_Switch is set to **0**, the IK controllers should be visible and active, while the FK controllers should be hidden. Setting the switch to **1** should
make the FK controllers visible and the IK controllers hidden.
![Testing the rig](/gifs/ikfkswitcher/ikfkswitch_15.gif "By doing that, animators are going to love you")

This small addition can save animators a lot of unnecessary clicking, improving their flow and focus on the tasks. Given that this setup is not time-consuming, there's no reason not to add it whenever you're working on any IFK switchable chain.


## 3. Closing Thoughts

Congratulations on creating your own IKFK switch in blender! This setup allows to seamlessly switch (and keyframe) between FK and IK, one of the most crucial rig features. Remember to experiment with different
setups and refine your rigging techniques to suit animator's needs - because rigs do not live in a vacuum!
