# The past few months have been busy. 
[In my last post](/posts/202505-skeletonhierarchy_blender) I was focused on building my Python skills as a part of my path towards becoming a **Technical Animator**.

Back then, I've taken ownership of Forever Skies' entire animation system as the only animator in post-release team. I've also applied for autumn edition of [**Rigging Dojo's**](https://www.riggingdojo.com/) **Character 101 course**
to strenghthen my core skills.

Since joining Far From Home in 2023, I've worked all across the animation pipeline: skinning, rigging, fpp & tpp animation for humanoids and creatures, in-engine implementation, sometimes small tool development in blender. I've collaborated with 
my Art Lead (and our only TechAnim) on all FS' AnimBPs. That's why I often called myself an **animation fullstack** - but I always knew where I wanted to head. Rigging & building tools for others has always been the endgame, and my UX background
gives me the mindset to look at the bigger picture.

In August, my ownership of the animation system officiall turned into a **promotion!**

Now, as the Autumn Term begins, I'm  oficially starting my journey with **Rigging Dojo's Character 101**.

The timing feels right. Self-learning has always been a challange for me - my motivation peaks righy after [Game Industry Conference](https://gic.gd/) wraps up and gradually fades during the year. The  month before GIC is usually when my batteries
are lowest, often spent chilling and playing games. That's why I'm glad to be starting this course now - guided mentorship and a community of super motivated peers keep me far 
more accountable than any video-only tutorial ever could. Rigging Dojo's reputation speaks for itself - I've even heard someone called them *"The Animation Mentor of Rigging"* - and from what I've seen so far - it is true.

My goals for the course are simple:
- Strenghten my rigging fundamentals - especially skinning, my weakest spot
- Refresh and expand my Maya skills (after two years in blender-based pipeline)
- Build confidence to tackle production challanges, or at least know where to look for help

This week, my mentor Brad Clark told us something that stuck: 

>
> This course is not only to teach you **how to rig**, it is as much here to teach you **how to learn about rigging**. 
> 
> --<cite> Brad Clark, Rigging Dojo's Character Rigging 101 Mentor </cite>

We won't cover everything in the coming weeks (advanced face rigs can wait), but I know this will be a strong foundation for the long term. I'm also excited that it fills a gap at FFH, where we don't have a dedicated rigger - 
and truth be told, nobody else really likes rigging.

This is the beginning of my **Rigging Dojo** journey and I'll be sharing reflections along the way. It's a way to track my progres, keep myself accountable and maybe inspire someone else considering the same path.

By the way, [**Game Industry Conference**](https://gic.gd/) in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland starts in 28 days - hope to see you there!
