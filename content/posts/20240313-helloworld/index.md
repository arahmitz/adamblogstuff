After overcoming some challanges of webdev (and trying to understand how networks and DNSes actually work) I am thrilled to extend a warm welcome to my personal website!
I envision this space evolving over time to not only serve as my online portfolio/professional site but also as a digitalized repository of my Notion/Confluence notes and tutorials on 
animation, rigging and working with blender/Maya/Unreal Engine and possibly other DCC softwares. My hope is that it becomes a valuable resource for anyone who stumbles
upon this site.

In addition, I've taken the opportunity to apply my front-end webdev skills (probably absorbed while working within front-dev team as UX/UI designer some time ago),
I am actually using [GoHugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework using the beautiful [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme! I've also took my time to properly setup everything
to work on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

As this posts marks the first blogpost, what better way to start than:

## Hello World!

Ps. Stay tuned for more updates and tutorials.
