*Animacyjne Dojo* is a presentation in polish that I've presented for Digital Night Studio (Lodz University of Technology) about gameplay animation. It mostly focuses on the basics, covering
gameplay animator viewpoint of animation - including tasks and specific challanges in everyday work. Besides that it focuses on basics of animating including principles of animations and most important exercises
like bouncing ball or tails with a little tips & tricks for each of them. It ends with a chapter about places where one can learn animation and kick-off their career.
