## Adam Madej Technical Animator webpage

This repository contains the source for my personal webpage.

I’m a Technical Animator working primarily with rigging, animation systems, and tools, with a focus on game-ready pipelines. The site is a place where I document my experience, share breakdowns, and occasionally write about problems I’ve solved (or am still solving).
